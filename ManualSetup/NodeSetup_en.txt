Instructions for running an active node on a vps server.

Download the Putty client from the official website for your local OS.

Run Putty, specify your vps server host or ip, port 22 and SSH by default, click the "Open" button.
In the terminal window, enter the given login (usually root) and password.
The password can be copied to the local OS and entered into Putty with a right click.
All commands are entered under the root superuser.

After authorization, you must:

1. Download the archive with the latest version for Linux from the repository https://github.com/DiplexSoftfork/Skyrcoin/releases:

   wget https://github.com/DiplexSoftfork/Skyrcoin/releases/download/v2.0.0.9-cs/skyrcoin-2.0.0.9-cs-linux-gnu-x64.tar.gz

2. Unpack 3 utilities from the archive:

   tar -xvf skyrcoin-2.0.0.9-cs-linux-gnu-x64.tar.gz

   conclusion:
   skyrcoind - node, daemon.
   skyrcoin-cli - rpc client for sending commands to a node
   skyrcoin-tx - utility "for working with transactions"


3. Copy utilities to /usr/bin or run from root:
    
   skyrcoind -daemon -txindex - run from /usr/bin directory
  
   or

   ./skyrcoind -daemon -txindex - run from tech. catalog

   conclusion:
Skyrcoin server starting

   On the first run, the .skyrcoin blockchain directory is created

4. Stop the daemon:
 
  ./skyrcoin-cli stop - graceful shutdown

   conclusion:
Skyrcoin server stopping
 
  Sometimes there are open tcp6 ports, after stopping the daemon can be killed with the command:

  pkill -9 -f skyrcoind

5. install the nano editor from an external repository:

  (apt-get update etc)

  apt-get -y install nano


6. Edit the configuration file:

  nano.skyrcoin/skyrcoin.conf

rpcuser=...your..user
rpcpassword=...your..pass
rpcport=16890
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
port=16888
daemon=1
txindex=1
staking=0
addnode=185.177.218.246 # <- ip of developer node

Save (Ctrl+O, Enter) and close the editor (Ctrl+X).


7. Run the node:

  ./skyrcoind
 
  or
  ./skyrcoind -daemon -txindex # keys are already redundant
  

8. Check node operation:

  ./skyrcoin-cli getinfo

9. Request the number of blocks and check the synchronization using the explorer

  ./skyrcoin-cli getblockcount

The number of blocks must match the number of explorer blocks.

To open the explorer, type In local OS browser: 185.177.218.246:3001

The launch of the node can be checked by another command to open. ports:

  netstst -tulnp | grep skyrcoind




10. Register the task for loading in case of reboot of the server in the task scheduler.

  crontab -e

  select the nano editor. If you make the wrong choice, delete the .crontabeditor (or similar) file.

Add a line at the end of the file (but this is not accurate, I did not restart c @reboot /root/skyrcoind -daemon -txindex):

  @reboot cd /root && .skyrcoind -daemon -txindex

Save and close the editor.

Check autostart after server reboot using rpc commands.
 




See the MasternodeSetup-ru.txt file for instructions on manually starting a masternode.


You can start masternode 1 with skyr-masternode-install.sh script.
